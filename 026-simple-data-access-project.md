### Create a maven-based project that uses Flyway(sql based migration at runtime), Hikari, and JDBI(on demand) backed by hikariCP  to  create, read, update and delete entries in a database.
### This project doesnt need to have any sort of UI or CLI, it just has to run and do the 4 operations. The goal is to learn how to configure these tools. 
### Example
